## Tendou for LightDM

A Windows 10 inspired theme for LightDM. [Try the demo](http://nejsan.github.io/lightdm-webkit-theme-tendou/) and see if you like it! This theme isn't intended to look exactly like Windows 10, but feel free to fork this and tweak the styles.

This theme allows for switching users, but not graphical sessions. It also allows you to shutdown/restart/sleep from the menu in the bottom right.

The code for the waiting indicator when logging in is based on [this pen](http://codepen.io/vineethtr/pen/GJpxoQ) by @vineethtrv.

### Roadmap
- [x] Messages for invalid passwords
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power actions
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for user switching
- [ ] Graphical session choice support
